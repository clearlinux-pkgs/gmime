### GMime 3.2.2

* Fixed packaging to include Vala files.

### GMime 3.2.1

* Fixed GMimeParser to recognize the message/global mime-type
  (a UTF-8 version of message/rfc822). (issue #50)

* Updated GMime to use libidn2 instead of the older libidn
  library. (issue #48)

* Fixed address quoting logic and IDN2 encoding.

    The rules for quoting address names should use 'specials'
    instead of 'tspecials' and when encoding domain names via
    IDN2, check if the encoded domain matches the original
    domain name (other than case). If they match, prefer the
    non-encoded domain name since the user may have used
    uppercase characters to enhance readability of the domain
    name.

* Added GMIME_DECRYPT_ENABLE_ONLINE_CERTIFICATE_CHECKS and
  GMIME_DECRYPT_ENABLE_KEYSERVER_LOOKUPS as possible flags to
  pass to g_mime_crypto_context_decrypt(). Also added
  GMIME_VERIFY_ENABLE_ONLINE_CERTIFICATE_CHECKS and
  GMIME_VERIFY_ENABLE_KEYSERVER_LOOKUPS as possible flags to
  pass to g_mime_crypto_context_verify().

    Clients that wish to enable online certificate and/or
    keyserver lookups now need to explicitly enable this
    functionality.
    
    These changes are designed to make it more difficult
    for clients to be susceptible to Efail privacy exploits.
    Specifically, it is meant to address the privacy concerns
    regarding CRL and OCSP status check backchannels.

    For more information about Efail, see https://www.efail.de/

* Fixed g_mime_message_write_to_stream() to prioritize message
  headers over body headers (even when they have an offset of -1).
  (issue #46)

* The GMimeParser can now warn about a number of RFC-compliance
  issues that it finds when parsing messages.

* Fixed GMimeTextPart to make sure that the GMimeFilterCharset is
  non-null before trying to use it. This can happen if the charset
  specified in the Content-Type header is unsupported by the
  iconv library.
